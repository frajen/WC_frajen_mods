#   1. is_screen_hold_on is False for Umaro's Cave trapdoor events, but they all include a hold screen / free screen

#       Talking to Cid always starts minecart event, but destination can take you elsewhere
#       What happens with MTek3 prize?  Is it triggered by minecart, or by entering Vector?

# Notes:
# 2009.  The transition out of Umaro's cave and back to Narshe should load the Narshe music, but instead just keeps
#   playing the Umaro music when randomized. I am not sure why this happens: look at the post-transition code for 2009?
#   Maybe something having to do with the door exit?
#
#   Music is going to be tricky in general: should we always load music when changing between maps with different
#   default music?  We probably want different behavior for different cases.
#       How do we figure out what the default music is for an area?
#
# 2010b. The transition to the correct location happens now, but the fade behavior is weird and the music is not loaded.
#   There's a momentary fade up on the cliff, fade down, transition, and then land animation & sound effect, no music.
#   Here's the code in the 2010 post-transition:
#       CC/3829: 6B    Load map $0119 (Umaro's Cave first room), place party at (14, 55), facing down
#       CC/382F: F4    Play sound effect 186
#       CC/3831: B2    Call subroutine $CCD9A6  <-- standard Umaro's cave trapdoor animation
#       CC/3835: 92    Pause for 30 units
#       CC/3836: F0    Play song 48 (Umaro), (high bit clear), full volume:  <-- "[0xf0, 0x30]" = [240, 48]
#       CC/3838: FE    Return
#   Fade behavior is weird because this is a 6B call instead of a 6A call; all the other transitions are 6A's
#       6A is "Fade out & load new map"; 6B is "Load new map assuming fadeout already happened."
#       They have the same parameters - so we can get around this by moving the split one byte later:
#       the original type of transition is preserved but destination is modified. IMPLEMENTED/NOT TESTED.
#   For the music, just patch in [0xf0, 0x30] just before the return bit.  IMPLEMENTED/NOT TESTED

# 2010. The Narshe Peak WoR jump into Umaro's cave event has a branch point (B6) at CC/37F0 (byte 10).  Code is:
#       B6 FE 37 02 F8 37 02 = (branch cmd) (choice 1 address bytes [x3]) (choice 2 address bytes [x3])
#   Choice address bytes are in order [low byte, mid byte, hi byte]; the address is also relative to offset $CA0000
#   so this translates as:  (Branch to) (1. CC/37FE [enter cave]) (2. CC/37F8 [return])
#   since we are copying the entire event with both branches, we need to patch these bytes with updated addresses:
#   specifically, we need to take them to e.g. 0C37FE + (New Address) - 0c37e7.  Also subtract 0A0000 (offset).
